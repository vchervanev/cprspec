# CPRSpec

Emergency spec runner for Competitive Programming in Ruby [early Beta version]

## How it works

CPRSpec expects the following file structure:

* A single `.rb` including RSpec unit tests guarded via `defined? RSpec` inside
* A set of `*.in.txt` and `*.out.txt` files with test data and expected output inside
* `CPRSpec.once` call from RSpec scope (to test solutions using provided input/output files)

During local development `$ rspec <problem.rb>` will run its unit tests and custom test suite as

```bash
cat <input-file> | ruby <solution-file`
```

and compare produced output vs expected output from `<output-file>`

## Watch mode

Executable command `cprspec` listens for changes in `*.rb`, `*.in.txt` and `*.out.txt` files and runs `rspec`.
If only a data (input/output) file is updated then only that file will be tested.

```bash
$ [bundle exec] cprspec
```

## WHY?

[TBD]

## Example

> problem.rb

```ruby
if defined? RSpec
  RSpec.describe 'my unit test' do
    it 'is here' do
      //
    end
  end
  CPRSpec.once
else
  while line = gets do
    puts line.chomp.reverse
  end
end
```

> 0-simplest-test.in.txt

```txt
12
34
```

> 0-simplest-test.out.txt

```txt
21
43
```

And then
> $ bundle exec rspec test.rb

```
my unit test
  is here

test suite
  0-syntax.in.txt
